Subject – Cracking leaked passwords
The result and analysis of my finding in context to this assessment are as follows. I have cracked the 
some of the leaked password using the Hashcat tool.

Hashing Algorithm used: MD5
Level of protection: MD5 (message digest algorithm) is a bad password hashing algorithm because it 
is too fast and memory conserving. Attacker can compute the hash of large number of passwords 
per second.
Recommendations to implement password:
- Try using better algorithm in place of MD5. Eg.SHA256
- Always use salts with hashes where feasible.
- for better security use slow algorithm like bcrypt. Which make harder for attacker because it 
requires more CPU cycles to authenticate user.
Observations on organization password policy:
- weak hash functions used with no salting
- common passwords are used which can be easily guessed and cracked
- No use of capital letters, numbers and special symbols together.
Changes to be made in password policy:
- we can increase the password length to 12 because less characters length it becomes easy for 
hacker to crack the password using brute force attack. 
- Don’t use common phrase as password. Use of mix characters.
- check your password security with password strength checker tools and websites.
